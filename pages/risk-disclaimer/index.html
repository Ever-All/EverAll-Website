          between independent traders ("Traders") and users who choose to follow
          their activity ("Followers"). EverAll does not:

        </ul>

        <h3>2. No Investment Advice</h3>
        <p>
          All content shared on EverAll â€” including trade alerts, opinions,
          signals, and strategies â€” is for informational and educational
          purposes only. It should not be construed as personalized investment
          advice or relied upon as the sole basis for making financial
          decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for evaluating the merits and risks
          associated with the use of any content or information provided through
          the platform.
        </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            Are responsible for the accuracy and content of their shared
