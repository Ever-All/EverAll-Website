          <li>
            Refund requests must be made within 14 days of initial purchase
          </li>
          <li>
            Refund amount will be the subscription cost minus all payment
            processing fees
          </li>
          <li>
            After the 14-day period, all subscription payments become strictly
            non-refundable
          </li>
          <li>Refunds are processed through the original payment method</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Non-Refundable Payments</h3>
        <p>The following are strictly non-refundable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All subscription renewal payments</li>

        <h3>3. Subscription Renewal Terms</h3>
        <p>
          By continuing your subscription beyond the initial 14-day period, you
          acknowledge and agree that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All future subscription payments are non-refundable</li>
          <li>
            Cancellations will stop future renewals but will not result in
            refunds
          </li>
          <li>
            You maintain access until the end of your current billing period

          <li>Early cancellation does not entitle you to a partial refund</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>5. Processing Time</h3>
