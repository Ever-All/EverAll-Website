        <p>
          EverAll respects intellectual property rights and expects its users to
          do the same. This DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) policy
          outlines procedures for reporting copyright infringement and how we
          handle such claims.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Reporting Copyright Infringement</h3>

            authorized agent
          </li>
          <li>Description of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed</li>
          <li>

        </ul>

        <h3>3. Counter-Notification</h3>

          infringers. A user who receives multiple copyright strikes may have
          their account suspended or terminated.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Good Faith Belief</h3>
        <p>
          We process DMCA notices in good faith and strive to follow the law
          while protecting both copyright holders and users' rights. False
          claims may lead to liability under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Modifications to Content</h3>
        <p>
          We may modify, prevent access to, or remove any content that we
          believe infringes copyrights, with or without notice.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Legal Jurisdiction and Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          All DMCA claims and counter-claims are processed under United States
          law. By submitting a DMCA notice or counter-notice, you consent to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            United States federal court jurisdiction for DMCA-related disputes
          </li>
          <li>Service of process via the email address you provide</li>
          <li>Application of United States copyright law to your claim</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          False claims may result in legal liability under 17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(f) of
          the DMCA, including costs and attorney's fees incurred by alleged
          infringers.
        </p>

          copyright protection. Users outside the U.S. may submit notices
          following similar procedures, but should reference their local
          copyright laws when applicable.
